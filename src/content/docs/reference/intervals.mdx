Much like [notes](../notes), Meantonal stores intervals as two-dimensional vectors. In fact, intervals are simply differences between two notes' vectors:

$$\sf{C_4} = (25, 10) \quad \sf{E_4} = (27, 10)$$

$$\sf{E_4} - \sf{C_4} = (2, 0)$$

So $(2, 0)$ is the unique vector that defines a major third.

<Aside>

If we interchange notes in the above calculation:

$$\sf{C_4} - \sf{E_4} = (-2, 0) = -(\sf{E_4} - \sf{C_4})$$

$(2, 0)$ is a major third _up_; $(-2, 0)$ is a major third _down_.

If $v$ is an interval vector, $-v$ represents the same interval in the opposite direction.

## Semitones

Western music distinguishes between two types of semitones: **diatonic semitones** and **chromatic semitones**:

- Diatonic semitones always span two different letters, such as C to D&flat;.
- Chromatic semitones are defined as the difference between a whole step and a diatonic semitone, and are always between two different "flavours" of the same letter, such as C to C&sharp;.

Since Meantonal defines the whole step as $(1, 0)$, and the diatonic semitone as $(0, 1)$ (they are chosen as its [standard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_basis)), the chromatic semitone is $(1, -1)$.

Different "qualities" of the same generic interval (such as major and minor thirds) are separated by chromatic semitones:

- A major third was seen to be $(2, 0)$
- A minor third is $(1, 1)$, or $(2, 0) - (1, -1)$
- An augmented third is $(3, -1)$, or $(2, 0) + (1, -1)$
- A diminished third is $(0, 2)$, or $(2, 0) - 2(1, -1)$

## Octaves

The octave is given by $(5, 2)$, which results naturally from the WWHWWWH formula of the major scale. As such, it is possible to create compound or simple versions of intervals by adding or subtracting multiples of $(5, 2)$

- A perfect fifth is $(3, 1)$
- A perfect twelfth is $(8, 3)$, or $(3, 1) + (5, 2)$

If subtracting or adding $(5, 2)$ causes an interval to cross to the other side of $(0, 0)$, it will be [inverted](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music)#Intervals>) at the octave.

- An ascending major third $(2, 0)$ will invert to a descending minor sixth $(-3, -2)$ when $(5, 2)$ is subtracted.

## Parsing intervals

The algorithm for constructing intervals from standard names like "A4" (for augmented fourth) or "m3" (for minor third) essentially works via the following steps:

<Steps>

1. Split the name into its generic size and quality.

   $$\sf{A4} \rightarrow (\sf{A},4)$$

2. Subtract 1 from the generic size to get its **stepspan**. This is the number of diatonic steps it contains; essentially a zero-indexed representation of its size, which is more amenable to arithmetic than the 1-indexed sizes used in conventional interval names.

   $$4 - 1 = 3$$

3. Use [Euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division) by 7. The remainder will represent the simple interval size, and the quotient will represent the number of octaves.

   $$3 \div 7 = 0, \;\sf{remainder}\; 3$$

   This enables simple and compound intervals to be handled by a single process.

4. The starting sizes of simple intervals follow a major scale:
   
   $$0 \rightarrow (0,0)$$

   $$1 \rightarrow (1,0)$$

   $$2 \rightarrow (2,0)$$

   $$3 \rightarrow (2,1)$$

   $$4 \rightarrow (3,1)$$

   $$5 \rightarrow (4,1)$$

   $$6 \rightarrow (5,1)$$

   Choose the corresponding vector and add the appropriate number of octaves obtained in the previous step:

   $$(2,1) + 0(5,2) = (2,1)$$

5. Add the correct number of chromatic semitones to arrive at the correct quality.

   AA $\rightarrow 2$

   A $\rightarrow 1$

   M or P $\rightarrow 0$

   m $\rightarrow -1$

   d $\rightarrow -1$ if the simple size of the interval is 0, 3 or 4

   d $\rightarrow -2$ otherwise

   dd $\rightarrow -2$ if the simple size of the interval is 0, 3 or 4

   dd $\rightarrow -3$ otherwise

   etc.

   "A4" $\rightarrow (2,1) + 1(1, -1) = (3, 0)$
