## Primitive Types

The two most fundamental types in Meantonal are `Note` and `Interval`, so let's begin by defining them.

### Note

A `Note` is a struct with two members, `w` and `h`.

```c
typedef struct {
    int w; // whole steps
    int h; // half steps
} Note;
```

- `w` holds the number of whole steps from $\sf{C}_{-1}$.
- `h` holds the number of half steps from $\sf{C}_{-1}$.

### Interval

An `Interval` is a struct with two members, `w` and `h`.

```c
typedef struct {
    int w; // whole steps
    int h; // half steps
} Interval;
```

- `w` holds the number of whole steps from the unison.
- `h` holds the number of half steps from the unison.

The `Note` and `Interval` type are effectively identical, and one can even be cast to the other. They are distinct because they generally represent different things. An `Interval` describes the distance *between* two `Note`s.

Check the [Notes](/learn/notes) and [Intervals](/learn/intervals) pages in the Learn category for an explanation of what these representations mean mathematically, and how they're constructed.

## Map Types

These types include mapping matrices for linear mapping operations and a special vector type to store the result of applying 2-dimensional maps.

### Map1d

The `Map1d` type represents a $1\times2$ matrix. Its members are labelled `m0` and `m1` to reinforce this.

```c
typedef struct {
    int m0, m1;
} Map1d;
```

Multiplying a `Map1d` matrix with a `Note` or `Interval` produces a single integer as the result.

Multiplying a $1\times2$ matrix with a 2d vector is equivalent to taking the dot product between two 2d vectors, so they can also be thought of as 2d vectors if you prefer.


### Map2d

The `Map2d` type represents a $2\times2$ matrix. Its members are labelled row-first, then column.

```c
typedef struct {
    int m00, m01;
    int m10, m11;
} Map2d;
```

Multiplying a `Map2d` matrix with a `Note` or `Interval` produces another 2d vector as the result, generally typed as `MappedVec`.

### MappedVec

The `MappedVec` type exists to store the vectors resulting from applying a `Map2d`, to reinforce the idea they they no longer represent regular Meantonal `Note` or `Interval` vectors, and prevent their accidental operation as such.

```c
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} MappedVec;
```

### MirrorAxis

The `MirrorAxis` type is to do with a different kind of mapping operation: pitch inversion about a fixed axis.

```c
typedef struct {
    int w;
    int h;
} MirrorAxis;
```

Slightly misleadingly, it looks like a regular `Note` or `Interval`, but this is strictly a result of how the inversion is applied.

## Alternative Representations

The following types store alternative representations of `Note` and `Interval` vectors. They correspond more closely with natural language, and can therefore potentially be useful as:
- An intermediate type on the way to pretty printing information about a group of musical objects to the end user.
- An intermediate type on the way to rendering standard notation.
- An intermediate parsing target from plaintext before converting into `Note` or `Interval` vectors.

### StandardNote

The `StandardNote` type stores notes in effectively the same fashion as [Scientific Pitch Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation): as a triple of `letter`, `accidental`, and `octave`.

```c
typedef struct {
    int letter;
    int accidental;
    int octave;
} StandardNote;
```
