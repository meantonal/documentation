Meantonal provides an assortment of constant `Map1D` and `Map2D` matrices to use with mapping operations. Most built-in functions in Meantonal abstract over the specific maps being used, so few users will ever need to touch them.

They are of particular utility, however, for people playing with tuning systems other than 12-tone equal temperament, or building graphical visualisations of generalised keyboard layouts.

## Basis Changes

These maps send any `Pitch` to its coordinates in the new basis, or vice versa.

### Wicki

These two maps can be used to go to and from the [Wicki-Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki%E2%80%93Hayden_pitch_layout) layout:

```c
const Map2D WICKI_TO = {1, -3, 0, 1};
const Map2D WICKI_FROM = {1, 3, 0, 1};
```

### Generators

These two maps can be used to go to and from a grid where the x-axis increments by perfect 5th, and the y-axis by octave.

```c
const Map2D GENERATORS_TO = {2, -5, -1, 3};
const Map2D GENERATORS_FROM = {3, 5, 1, 2};
```

This is potentially useful when calculating concrete pitches from Meantonal's abstract `Pitch` vectors in non-EDO tuning systems such as quarter comma meantone, where there are an infinite number of distinct pitches in the system, since it is **generated** entirely by its fifth and octave (hence the name of this map).

## Miscellaneous

### `CONCERT_C`

This constant is useful when creating a [`TuningMap`](/c/types/#tuningmap). It sets a value of C4 that corresponds to A4 = 440Hz in 12-tone equal temperament. The frequency of all Cs thereby remains fixed in different tunings.
