Meantonal provides an assortment of constant `Map1d` and `Map2d` matrices to use with mapping operations. Most functions in Meantonal abstract over the specific maps being used, so most use cases won't ever need to touch them.

They are of particular utility, however, for people playing with tuning systems other than 12-tone equal temperament, or building graphical visualisations of generalised keyboard layouts.

## EDO Maps

These maps send any `Note` or `Interval` to its representation as EDO-steps in a given equal temperament.

```c
const Map1d ET7 = {1, 1};
const Map1d ET12 = {2, 1};
const Map1d ET19 = {3, 2};
const Map1d ET31 = {5, 3};
const Map1d ET50 = {5, 3};
const Map1d ET55 = {5, 4};
```

## Basis Changes

These maps send any `Note` to its coordinates in the new basis, or vice versa.

### Wicki

These two maps can be used to go to and from the [Wicki-Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki%E2%80%93Hayden_note_layout) layout:

```c
const Map2d WICKI_TO = {1, -3, 0, 1};
const Map2d WICKI_FROM = {1, 3, 0, 1};
```

These two maps can be used to go to and from a grid where the x-axis increments by perfect 5th, and the y-axis by octave. This is potentially useful when calculating the pitch of notes in tuning systems such as quarter comma meantone, where there are an infinite number of distinct notes in the system, since it is generated entirely by its fifth and octave.

```c
const Map2d GENERATORS_TO = {2, -5, -1, 3};
const Map2d GENERATORS_FROM = {3, 5, 1, 2};
```
