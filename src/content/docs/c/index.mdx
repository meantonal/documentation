This reference details the types and functions provided by the C implementation of Meantonal.

External link to the project repo can be found below.

If you haven't already, add Meantonal to your project with the following script:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bash">
```bash frame=none
curl https://meantonal.org/meantonal.h > meantonal.h
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You must `#define MEANTONAL` in exactly **one** file before the first inclusion of `meantonal.h`:

```c
// foo.c
#define MEANTONAL
#include "meantonal.h"
```

After that, just include `meantonal.h` in any other files as needed.

```c
// bar.c
#include "meantonal.h"
```
