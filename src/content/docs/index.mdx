	<Card title="Flexible representation" icon="translate">
		Easily ingest and translate between Scientific Pitch Notation, Helmholtz notation, ABC and Lilypond. Extract MIDI values at any time.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Spelling matters" icon="pencil">
        C&#x266f; and D&#x266d; are different notes. A major third and a diminished fourth are different intervals. Meantonal is semantically nondestructive.
	</Card>
	<Card title="It's just vectors" icon="random">
		Under the hood notes and intervals are 2d vectors. Operations are simple to understand, composable and fast to execute.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Tuning-agnostic" icon="seti:audio">
		Target any meantone tuning system, not just 12-tone equal temperament. You want 31 tones per octave? Done.
