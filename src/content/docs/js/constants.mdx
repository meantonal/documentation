## Basis Changes

These [`Map2D`](/js/map) constants are available to change to and from:
- The [Wicki-Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki%E2%80%93Hayden_note_layout) coordinate system of (M2, P5) vs. Meantonal's (M2, m2).
- The "generators" map of (P5, P8), which is useful for mapping arbitrary note names to frequencies in non-EDO meantone tuning systems like [quarter-comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-comma_meantone) or [golden meantone](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Golden_meantone), which have an infinite number of pitches and are generated by their octave and fifth.

```ts
const WICKI_TO = new Map2D(1, -3, 0, 1);
const WICKI_FROM = new Map2D(1, 3, 0, 1);
const GENERATORS_TO = new Map2D(2, -5, -1, 3);
const GENERATORS_FROM = new Map2D(3, 5, 1, 2);
```
