## EDO Maps

A small selection of `Map1D` constants are available to map from `Pitch` or `Interval` vectors to EDO-steps in the designated EDO tuning system.

```ts
const EDO7 = new Map1D(1, 1);
const EDO12 = new Map1D(2, 1);
const EDO17 = new Map1D(3, 1);
const EDO19 = new Map1D(3, 2);
const EDO22 = new Map1D(4, 1);
const EDO31 = new Map1D(5, 3);
const EDO50 = new Map1D(8, 5);
const EDO53 = new Map1D(9, 4);
const EDO55 = new Map1D(9, 5);
const EDO81 = new Map1D(13, 8);
```

## Basis Changes

These [`Map2D`](/js/map) constants are available to change to and from:
- The [Wicki-Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki%E2%80%93Hayden_note_layout) coordinate system of (M2, P5) vs. Meantonal's (M2, m2).
- The "generators" map of (P5, P8), which is useful for mapping arbitrary note names to frequencies in non-EDO meantone tuning systems like [quarter-comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-comma_meantone) or [golden meantone](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Golden_meantone), which have an infinite number of pitches and are generated by their octave and fifth.

```ts
const WICKI_TO = new Map2D(1, -3, 0, 1);
const WICKI_FROM = new Map2D(1, 3, 0, 1);
const GENERATORS_TO = new Map2D(2, -5, -1, 3);
const GENERATORS_FROM = new Map2D(3, 5, 1, 2);
```
