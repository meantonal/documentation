Meantonal provides some classes to parse to and from common formats:

- `SPN` handles [Scientific Pitch Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation)
- `LilyPond` handles [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/) strings.
- `Helmholtz` handles [Helmholtz Pitch Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_pitch_notation).
- `ABC` handles [ABC notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation).

Each provides static `toPitch` and `fromPitch` methods to convert between strings and [`Pitch`](/js/pitch) vectors.

Using `SPN`, here's an example usage:

```ts
let p = SPN.toPitch("C#4");

SPN.fromPitch(p); // "C#4");
```

These helper classes are not robust enough to be used to parse LilyPond or ABC files directly. They are just for enterring and printing `Pitch` names in familiar formats.
