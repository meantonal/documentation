The `Axis` class is used to invert [`Pitch`](/js/pitch) vectors about a fixed point via [`Pitch.invert`](/js/pitch/#invert).

### Class Constructor

```ts
constructor(p: Pitch, q: Pitch);
```

An `Axis` is constructed from two `Pitch` vectors, which would be sent to each other via inversion about the resultant axis.

```ts
let axis = new Axis(
    SPN.toPitch("C4");
    SPN.toPitch("G4");
);

let p = SPN.toPitch("E4");
p.invert(axis); // "Eb4"
```
