The `MirrorAxis` class is used to invert [`Pitch`](/js/pitch) vectors about a fixed point via [`Pitch.invert`](/js/pitch/#invert).

### Class Constructor

```ts
constructor(p: Pitch, q: Pitch);
```

A `MirrorAxis` is constructed from two `Pitch` vectors, which would be sent to each other via inversion about the resultant axis.

```ts
let axis = new MirrorAxis(
    SPN.toPitch("C4");
    SPN.toPitch("G4");
);

let p = SPN.toPitch("E4");
p.invert(axis); // "Eb4"
```

### `fromSPN`

```ts
static fromSPN(ps: string, qs: string): MirrorAxis;
```

Creates a `MirrorAxis` using [SPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation) strings for two `Pitch` vectors which would be sent to each other via inversion about the resultant axis.
