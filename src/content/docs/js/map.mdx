The classes in this section allow arbitrary $1\times2$ or $2\times2$ matrices to be multiplied by vectors.

## `MapVec`

The `MapVec` provides a generic vector type that 2-dimensional mapping operations can return, and provides methods to be converted into a [`Pitch`](/js/pitch) or [`Interval`](/js/pitch) vector as required.

`MapVec` follows the shape of `Pitch` and `Interval`, exposing two fields:

```ts
x: number;
y: number;
```

### Class Constructor

```ts
constructor(x: number, y: number);
```

Simple pass in coordinates to instantiate a vector:

```ts
let v = new MapVec(12, 5);
```

### `toPitch`

```ts
toPitch(): Pitch;
```

Converts a `MapVec` into a `Pitch` vector.

```ts
let v = new MapVec(25, 10);
let p = v.toPitch();

p.w; // 25
p.h; // 10
```

### `toInterval`

```ts
toInterval(): Interval;
```

Converts a `MapVec` into an `Interval` vector.

```ts
let v = new MapVec(5, 2);
let m = v.toInterval();

p.w; // 5
p.h; // 2
```

## `Map1d`

A `Map1d` is a $1\times2$ matrix, used to map a 2-dimensional vector to a 1-dimensional number. Conceptually, many of Meantonal's `Pitch` and `Interval` queries utilise this principle under the hood (see the [Learn](/learn/maps) page for a detailed explanation).

### Class Constructor

```ts
constructor(m0: number, m1: number);
```

Creates a matrix $[m0, m1]$:

```ts
let A = new Map1d(5, 3);
```

### `map`

```ts
map(v: MapVec | Pitch | Interval): number;
```

Carries out the mapping operation on the passed in vector. Result will be a number.

```ts
let A = new Map(5, 3); // 31EDO mapping matrix
let p = Pitch.fromSPN("G4");

A.map(p); // sends p to 18, essentially a MIDI style mapping for 31EDO
```

## `Map2d`

A `Map1d` is a $2\times2$ matrix, used to map a 2-dimensional vector to another 2-dimensional vector. Essentially effects a change of coordinate system: (see the [Learn](/learn/maps) page for a detailed explanation).

### Class Constructor

```ts
constructor(m00: number, m01: number, m10: number, m11: number);
```

Creates a matrix: $\begin{bmatrix} m00 & m01 \\ m10 & m11 \end{bmatrix}$

```ts
let A = new Map2d(1, 2, 3, 4);
```

### `map`

```ts
map(v: MapVec | Pitch | Interval): MapVec;
```

Carries out the mapping operation on the passed in vector. Result will be a generic `MapVec`.

```ts
let A = new Map2d(2, -5, -1, 3); // basis change: (w, h) => (P5, P8)
let p = Pitch.fromSPN("E5");

A.map(p) // (4, 3)
```
