This section details how Meantonal stores and operates on musical data. It is intended to provide you with enough information to truly understand how Meantonal *works*, and to extend its functionality as your specific needs require.

Mathematics ahead. It's not too bad, but you have been warned.

In order to understand how [notes](../notes) and [intervals](../intervals) are represented, and the various operations that can be carried out, familiarity with elementary [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) is needed. In particular, you will want to be comfortable with:

- Vector addition and scalar multiplication.
- The dot product and what it means for two vectors to be orthogonal.
- Matrices and matrix multiplication.
- Linear maps and the null space of a matrix.

All of Meantonal's operations are very simple, but understanding these concepts will help greatly with acquiring intuitions about what's actually going on under the hood.

[3Blue1Brown's YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) is an excellent introduction to all the relevant topics.
