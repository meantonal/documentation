Here are some basic facts about the sets our musical information lives in:

- Pitch is 1-dimensional: frequencies are real numbers.
    - That is: they live in $\R$.
- Meantonal's Note and Interval vectors are discrete and 2-dimensional.
    - That is: they live in $\Z\times\Z$.
- Tuning systems like 12-tone equal temperament have a finite number of notes per octave.
    - That is, they live in $\Z$.
- Abstractions like "12 tone pitch class" or "scale degree" have a finite total number of values, and work by modular arithmetic.
    - That is, they live in $\Z_n$ for some $n$.

Most of Meantonal's information querying is done via [linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) from $\Z\times\Z$ to $\Z$ via multiplication with a $1\times2$ mapping matrix. Modular information like pitch class is then queried via taking remainders after regular euclidean division.

No linear map from $\Z\times\Z$ to $\Z$ is two-way. If $\sf{C}\sharp_4$ and $\sf{D}\flat_4$ both map to the MIDI number 61, the mapping was not **one-to-one**. No inverse map can exist.

No mapping from $\Z$ to $\Z_n$ is two way. If MIDI numbers 65 and 77  are both mapped to the 12-tone pitch class 5 the mapping was not **one-to-one**. No inverse map can exist.

These sorts of mappings are called **semantically destructive** in Meantonal.

Meantonal tries to preserve semantic information. This is achieved by keeping data in vector format wherever possible, and then simply **extracting** lower-dimensional representations when they are required.

<Aside type="caution">

If you are integrating Meantonal into an existing project where musical information is stored differnetly, it may only be possible to translate in one direction: **from** Meantonal's representation.

If multiple Note or Interval vectors map to the same value in your system, the mapping is not one-to-one, and no inverse mapping can exist.

</Aside>

This means you will generally want to place any 1-dimensional pitch handling **downstream** of vector-based data structures and operations. Query MIDI or pitch class values, and operate them directly if possible, before continuing to operate on the original Note or Interval vectors the information was extracted from.
