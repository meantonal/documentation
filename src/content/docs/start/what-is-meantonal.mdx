Meantonal is a library for representing, querying and manipulating musical notes, intervals, and objects built from them in a **semantically sensitive** way.

It naturally distinguishes between enharmonics such as C♯ and D♭, while being aware of their enharmonicity.

## Implementations

Currently there is a [C implementation](/c) and a [TypeScript implementation](/js) of Meantonal, and they are maintained side by side.

<Aside type="tip">

The [Learn](/learn) section explores the mathematics powering Meantonal under the hood, in case you're curious or want to extend its functionality!
