Both the library and these docs are still under construction. Watch this space.

Meantonal is a library for representing, querying and manipulating musical notes, intervals, and objects built from them in a **semantically sensitive** way.

It naturally distinguishes between enharmonics such as C♯ and D♭, while being aware of their enharmonicity.

## Implementations

Currently there is a C implementation of Meantonal in development. When it is more mature, a TypeScript and Python implementation are planned.
