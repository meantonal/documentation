import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Currently there is only one version of Meantonal, implemented in C. Adding it to your project is as simple as copying the [`meantonal.h`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meantonal/meantonal/refs/heads/master/meantonal.h) header file somewhere into your project's directory, which can be done via the following bash script:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bash">
```bash frame=none
curl https://meantonal.org/meantonal.h > meantonal.h
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You must `#define MEANTONAL` in exactly **one** file before the first inclusion of `meantonal.h`:

```c
// foo.c
#define MEANTONAL
#include "meantonal.h"

Pitch c4, e4; // declares but does not assign values to two Pitch vectors
Pitch g4 = { 28, 11 }; // directly initialises a Pitch
// assigning values
if (pitch_from_spn("C4", &c4))
    fprintf(stderr, "error parsing pitch from SPN");
if (pitch_from_spn("E4", &e4))
    fprintf(stderr, "error parsing pitch from SPN");

Interval M3 = interval_between(c4, e4); // creates a major 3rd Interval vector
Interval P5 = interval_between(c4, g5); // creates a perfect 5th interval vector

// etc.
```

After that, just include `meantonal.h` in any other files as needed.

```c
// bar.c
#include "meantonal.h"

Pitch p;
if (pitch_from_spn("E4", &p))
    fprintf(stderr, "error parsing pitch from SPN");

MirrorAxis a;
if (axis_from_spn("C4", "G4"))
    fprintf(stderr, "error parsing pitch(es) from SPN when creating MirrorAxis");

pitch_invert(p, a); // p has been inverted about the axis to Eb4

// etc.
```
